      At <strong class="text-foreground">Posit</strong>, I develop tools that enhance data scientists' workflows. My career spans multiple disciplines—from being a journalist at the <strong class="text-foreground">New York Times</strong> to a data scientist at <strong class="text-foreground">Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab</strong> and even a "data artist in residence" at a geospatial visualization startup.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-6 leading-relaxed">
      My <strong class="text-foreground">Ph.D. from Vanderbilt University</strong> focused on statistical methodologies for network data, deep learning, and data visualization. At the <strong class="text-foreground">University of Vermont</strong>, I studied statistics, mathematics, and computer science.

      When I am not in "work mode," I enjoy photographing birds and my daughter, running and hiking, reading science fiction, and contributing to open-source projects.
