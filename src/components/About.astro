    <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
      At <strong class="highlight-place">Posit</strong>, I develop tools that enhance data scientists' workflows. My career spans multiple disciplinesâ€”from being a journalist at the <strong class="highlight-place">New York Times</strong> to a data scientist at <strong class="highlight-place">Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab</strong> and even a "data artist in residence" at a geospatial visualization startup.

    <p class="mt-4 leading-relaxed">
      My <strong>Ph.D. from <span class="highlight-place">Vanderbilt University</span></strong> focused on <RoughNotation type="underline" color="var(--color-chart-5)">statistical methodologies for network data, deep learning, and data visualization.</RoughNotation> At the <strong class="highlight-place">University of Vermont</strong>, I studied statistics, mathematics, and computer science.

      When I am not in "work mode," I enjoy photographing birds and my daughter, running and hiking, reading science fiction, and contributing to open-source projects.
