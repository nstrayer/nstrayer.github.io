# Progress: Nick Strayer's Personal Website

## Current Status

The website is in active development with core functionality implemented. Based on the codebase examination, the project appears to be in a beta/near-complete state with the main structure and components in place. Recent efforts have focused on mobile optimization, performance improvements, and UI refinements.

### What Works

âœ… **Core Site Structure**
- Basic layout and page organization is complete
- All main sections are implemented (Hero, About, Projects, Skills, Contact)
- Navigation between sections is functional

âœ… **WebGL Background Animation**
- Interactive particle system is implemented and working
- Shaders are properly configured for visual effects including particle and line rendering
- Mouse interaction with particles is functional
- Connects nearby particles with lines to create a network effect
- Includes a subtle grain texture for improved aesthetics
- Text readability improved with backdrop blur filters
- Accessibility considerations for reduced motion are implemented
- Optimized to prevent re-rendering on window resize events
- Performance improvements for smoother animations

âœ… **Content Implementation**
- About section with biographical information
- Projects loaded from CSV data
- Skills section with categorized skills
- Contact information

âœ… **Technical Foundation**
- Astro framework configuration
- TypeScript setup and type definitions
- WebGL infrastructure for background animation
- Data loading and processing for projects
- Responsive design foundations
- Consolidated CSS for improved maintainability
- Mobile navigation improvements

### What's Left to Build

ðŸ”„ **Responsive Design Refinements**
- Continue testing and optimizing for various device sizes
- Further improve experience consistency across different screen sizes
- Fine-tune typography at different breakpoints
- Build on recent mobile navigation and scrolling improvements

ðŸ”„ **Performance Optimization**
- Review and optimize WebGL particle count and complexity
- Implement image optimization for project thumbnails
- Analyze and minimize JavaScript bundle size

ðŸ”„ **Content Enhancements**
- Review and potentially expand project descriptions
- Add any missing projects or content
- Ensure consistent imagery across all projects

ðŸ”„ **Deployment Setup**
- Configure production build process
- Set up hosting and deployment pipeline
- Implement domain configuration

ðŸ”„ **SEO and Metadata**
- Add proper meta tags for search engines
- Implement social sharing metadata
- Set up analytics tracking

## Known Issues

1. **WebGL Performance**
   - May need further optimization for lower-powered devices
   - Potential for high CPU/GPU usage with many particles
   - Recent improvements have helped by preventing unnecessary re-rendering

2. **Browser Compatibility**
   - WebGL2 support is required for full experience
   - Need to implement or improve fallback for browsers without WebGL2

3. **Mobile Experience**
   - Fixed some issues with scrolling and navigation on mobile
   - Some areas may still need refinement for optimal mobile user experience

4. **Content Management**
   - CSV-based project data may become unwieldy as the project list grows
   - Consider more robust content management for future updates

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### From Template to Customization
The project began with an Astro basic template (as seen in the README.md) and has evolved into a customized personal site. The original template structure has been maintained, but significantly extended with custom components and features.

### Background Animation Development
According to git commits, the site transitioned from an earlier background animation approach to the current WebGL-based particle system. This represents a technical advancement in the visual presentation of the site.

### Data Management Strategy
The decision to use CSV for project data reflects a pragmatic approach to content management, balancing ease of updates with integration into the build process. This replaced what may have been hardcoded project data in earlier versions.

## Next Milestones

### Short-term (Next 1-2 Weeks)
1. Complete responsive design testing and refinements
2. Optimize WebGL performance for all target devices
3. Finalize content and imagery
4. Set up deployment pipeline

### Medium-term (Next 1-2 Months)
1. Implement SEO optimizations
2. Add analytics tracking
3. Consider adding blog or content section
4. Gather user feedback and make refinements

### Long-term (Future Considerations)
1. Evaluate more robust content management approach
2. Consider adding dark mode support
3. Explore adding interactive visualizations for projects
4. Implement automatic project updates from GitHub
